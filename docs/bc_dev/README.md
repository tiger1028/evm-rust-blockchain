# Blockchain Developer

SputnikVM is designed to support multiple blockchains. Our goal is to have a virtual machine that can support multiple blockchains. This poses some difficulty as each blockchain tends to arrive at different parameters derived by their community's preferences.

SputnikVM is configurable in that it parameters can be passed into the Virtual Machine before VM instantiation. Parameters such as gas cost and other variables will be supported.
